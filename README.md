## Introduction

📰🤖 Fake news refers to misinformation or disinformation spread through various channels, including word of mouth and digital communication platforms like WhatsApp messages and social media posts. It spreads faster than real news, creating significant societal issues such as fear and misunderstanding. This project aims to address these problems using classical NLP techniques to classify whether a given message or text is real or fake.

## Skills/Concepts Developed

🔍 Text preprocessing using NLP techniques
📊 Implementing Bag of n-grams
🛠️ Building classification models using different algorithms
🔍 Model evaluation and comparison
📊 Visualization of model performance with confusion matrices
